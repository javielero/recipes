2 (10 ounce) cans black beans, liquid drained and reserved
1 medium onion, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt

Fry the onion and pepper in a little oil.
Add the garlic and saute a little.

These are quite good when served over a bed of rice seasoned with just lime.
